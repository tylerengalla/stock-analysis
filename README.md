# stock-analysis

# Overview of Project

Steve needs help to analyze stock performances similar to the ones his parents are interested in investing in - particularly around Green Energy Stocks.  

We're going to use VBA to help us understand how Daqo (the company's stock Steve's parents are interested in) compares in terms of total daily volume (or shares traded throughout the day - measuring how active the stock is) and the yearly return for each stock. 

But we also want to be able to use these macros for future analysis if needed - so we'll create buttons to help them run this analsis and understand if this or any other stock would be a good investment.  


# Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

From running our macros to return the Total Daily Volume and the Return for our stocks we can see how DQ is doing compared to the other stocks. 

In 2017 - Daqo was not heavily traded compared to the other stocks but yielded the highest return at 199.4%.

Below you can see how fast we were able to run this subroutine:

In 2018 - Daqo tripled it's Total Daily Volume and yielded a negative return of -62.6%. Noticeably though, all but two of the stocks yielded negative returns meaning the industry as a whole is on a downward trend as compared to the previous year where only 1 stock yielded negative returns. This could be a good time to buy.

Below you can see how fast we were able to run the subroutine on the second year.

# Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.


# What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?


# How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
