# stock-analysis

# Overview of Project

Steve needs help to analyze stock performances similar to the ones his parents are interested in investing in - particularly around Green Energy Stocks.  

We're going to use VBA to help us understand how Daqo (the company's stock Steve's parents are interested in) compares in terms of total daily volume (or shares traded throughout the day - measuring how active the stock is) and the yearly return for each stock. 

But we also want to be able to use these macros for future analysis if needed - so we'll create buttons to help them run this analsis and understand if this or any other stock would be a good investment.  


# Results

From running our macros to return the Total Daily Volume and the Return for our stocks we can see how DQ is doing compared to the other stocks. 

In 2017 - Daqo (DQ) was not heavily traded compared to the other stocks but yielded the highest return at 199.4%.

Below you can see how fast we were able to run this subroutine:

In 2018 - Daqo (DQ) tripled it's Total Daily Volume and yielded a negative return of -62.6%. Noticeably though, all but two of the stocks yielded negative returns meaning the industry as a whole is on a downward trend as compared to the previous year where only 1 stock yielded negative returns. This could be a good time to buy.

Below you can see how fast we were able to run the subroutine on the second year.

# Summary
* Advantages of refactoring code is that you're not starting from scratch and already have a solution to the problem you're looking to solve. You just have to optimize it now. 
* Disadvantages is that you could potentially be following somebody else's code logic and have to "get up to speed" and be hopeful that they provided good enought comments to follow their thread. 

Luckily we were part of the original VBA so we were familiar, but I can see that not always being the case.
