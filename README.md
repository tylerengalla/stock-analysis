# stock-analysis

# Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Steve, our client, needs help to analyze stock performances similar to the ones his parents are interested in investing in - particularly around Green Energy Stocks.  
We're going to use VBA to help us understand how DAQO (the company Steve's parents are interested in) compares in terms volume of trades the stock has gone through and what the return has been. 
But we want to be able to use these macros for future analysis if needed - so we'll create a macros and buttons to help them understand if this or any other future stock would be a good investment.
